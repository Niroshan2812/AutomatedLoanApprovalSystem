#  Automated Loan Approval System

An **AI-powered loan approval system** that automates customer loan applications, credit risk analysis, and approval decisions using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.  
The system integrates **Spring Boot + PostgreSQL** for core business logic and database management, with optional **Python RL models** for decision-making.

##  Project Vision
Banks and financial institutions often face challenges in loan approval due to **manual verification, bias, and inefficiency**.  
This project aims to:
- Automate loan application workflows  
- Use **AI-driven decision-making** to minimize risk  
- Provide an **admin dashboard** for monitoring approvals, repayments, and profitability  
- Continuously learn from outcomes using **Reinforcement Learning**

 Admin Role (approve/reject/modify applications)  
 Reinforcement Learning Agent for loan decisions  
 REST APIs for loan processing and AI integration  
 Optional dashboard (JavaFX / Thymeleaf)  
 Advanced modules: Explainable AI, fraud detection, multi-agent RL
